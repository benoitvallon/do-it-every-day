# Do it every day

Haven't you often tell yourself things like...

> I should go running in the morning more than once a week

or like...

> I should read every day instead of "when I have the time" before going to sleep

Do it every day wants to help you tracking when you actually do these things. Being able to see how often we do things in a very visual way helped us to understand why we have done things some days and not others.

# Who am I?

I am Benoit, a senior JavaScript developer. I freshly arrived in New York City and I wanted to do a bit of Ruby on Rails to change my mind for a while.

So I made this app which is my first one in Rails.

I hope you like it. Tell me what you think.

# Install

```shell

# Run the app

## In the local environment

Launch the rails web server with the following command and visit http://localhost:3000.

```shell

```

# Push the modifications to Heroku
